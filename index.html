    <p>Valorant is a 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) where one team attacks and the other defends. The main game mode, Search and Destroy, is very similar to CS:GO. The attacking team’s goal is to plant a bomb (called a spike) and have it detonate, while the defending team tries to avoid that. Regardless of whether the spike is planted or not, if a squad is wiped out before any other victory condition is met, the opposing squad will win. a 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) where one team attacks and the other defends.

    <p>These are specs that your computer needs to run in order to play the game. If you don't have these specs, the game could be really slow or could crash your computer.</p>
  <h1>Best Peripherals</h1>
<p>For Valorant, gamers use laptop keyboards all the way to the Logitech G PRO X. If you have just started playing, you should use something like a Razer Ornata. For a good mouse, you should use a Razer Deathadder, a Logitech G502 Hero, or Logitech G Pro X Superlight. </p>
